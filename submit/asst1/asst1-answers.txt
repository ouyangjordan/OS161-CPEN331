1.When a trap occurs the trap handler is invoked located here:

arch/mips/locore/trap.c # Common trap handler.

The first line that is executed is this function in the trap.c file:
mips_trap(struct trapframe *tf)

Control gets transferred from that point to killing the process if the
trap is a fatal fault.

If it is an interrupt then control gets passed to the interrupt handler on this line:
/* Interrupt? Call the interrupt handler and return. */
if (code == EX_IRQ) {

This is different because it just returns and restores the process after the interrupt

2.In the same arch/mips/locore/trap.c there is a function enter_new_process. This is the part of the code that invokes system calls from user programs and causes traps. On line 423 I found this code. It causes traps when it calls mips_usermode(&tf); on line 437

There are libc functions in the common part of the source tree as well as in the userland/lib/libc because the configure script
only configures the OS/161 dist and build system. It does not configure the OS kernel, for which there is a different configuration in
another area. That is why the libc functions must be duplicated, as the other configuration script needs it for 
configuring the OS system kernel.

4.

Two things the configure file configures are the OS/161 distribution and build system.

You may want to re run it if you are not at the top of the os161 tree

5.

Signs a function may be machine dependent are having userptr_t as an argument.
I.E it needs a valid address to run, which comes from the machine.

In machine independent code it can use machine-dependent C setjmp/longjmp
facility to perform recovery from invalid address.

It is important to maintain this separation so that machine dependent code does
not take invalid addresses that machine independent code could handle.

6.

The size of a trapframe is 36 32 bit registers total, or 32 32 bit saved registers.

It is that size so it can save the userstate when the exception is handled. This is because
there are 32 32 bit registers in os161, and we can return to the process once 
the exceptions are cancelled.

7.

If you run "config" INSTEAD OF "./config" you may run the wrong script (system kernel config)
and will have to re run the config script

You may have to re run the script if the configuration that this script is checking 
is not a valid configuration for the supported architecture. This requires to make the config into
a valid configuration.

8.

“Rerun bmake depend if/when you change header file inclusions, or after re-running config. Otherwise, there is no need to repeat it. Rerun bmake to recompile as needed.”

9.

If you rerun bmake depend to recomplie the kernel you should run bmake install to copy over the kernel to os161/root again.

10.

You could run hello world by
putting it in a file that is currently being run at startup like
src/kern/arch/sys161/dev/lamebus_machdep.c,
and insert a 

kprintf(“Hello world”);

after line 100 which prints
kprintf("lamebus0 (system main bus)\n");
on startup

You then have to recompile os161

You must also rebuild the kernel using
bmake depend
bmake
bmake install 

in the kern/compile/DUMBVM

17.  Assembly instructions are executing the preliminary instructions to prepare to
run sys161.

These assembly instructions save return addresses, sets up a boot stack for sys161,
initializing necessary registers, and setting up the stack frame, setting up status 
registers etc.
